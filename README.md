We used SQL to clean Covid19 dataset to gain an insight on the infected and cured victims.
**About Dataset**
**Purpose**
This dataset, which has the number of tests conducted over time, is important to help making sense of daily reported cases and understanding how COVID-19 is truly spreading in each country.

**Context**
We generally use daily reported positive cases to understand how COVID-19 is spreading in different countries. However, given that potentially over 50% of the cases are asymptomatic, these population are much less likely to seek testing and get tested. Therefore the reported cases are highly likely to be only a portion of the population who are truly infected by COVID-19, and the number of reported cases has a strong relation to the number of tests conducted each day.

For example, you can imagine a country not doing much testing might be reporting low number of cases, but it doesn't mean COVID-19 is not spreading in that country. To help making sense of daily reported cases and understanding how COVID-19 is truly spreading in each country, it's crucial to understand how many tests are conducted each day.

**Data Preprocessing**
We used SQL to join the data using join function into a single table.
The data was cleaned: All the empty columns and irrevent data were removed.
Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) were also used to summarize and aggregate the data.


**Result**
After analyzing the data, it was observed that the country with the highest number of case is United State followed by India, France, Germany and the rest.
